# Spring Boot Interview Questions

### 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery Attack
- What is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, and how can it be prevented in a Spring Boot application?

### 2. Dynamic Bean Injection
- You have a Spring Boot application with multiple beans of the same type, and you want to inject a specific bean based on a condition at runtime. How would you achieve this without using `@Qualifier` directly at the injection point? Additionally, consider that the decision criteria might change dynamically. Explain your approach and how it can be managed efficiently.

### 3. CORS in Spring Boot
- Explain what CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is and how to configure it in a Spring Boot application.

### 4. Types of Dependency Injection
- What are the different types of dependency injection available in Spring? Explain the differences between constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection.

### 5. Join Point in Spring Boot
- What is a join point in Spring, and how is it used in the context of AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)?

### 6. Setting Active Profile in Spring Boot
- How can you set an active profile in a Spring Boot application? Discuss different methods to configure profiles for various environments.

### 7. Versioning and Backward Compatibility
- How do you handle versioning and backward compatibility in RESTful APIs built with Spring Boot?

### 8. Handling Distributed Transactions
- How do you handle distributed transactions across multiple microservices in a Spring Boot application?

### 9. Implementing Caching
- How do you implement caching in a Spring Boot application? Explain the different caching strategies and providers available.

### 10. Distributed Tracing in Microservices
- How do you implement distributed tracing in a Spring Boot microservices environment?

### 11. Handling Cross-Cutting Concerns
- How do you handle cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, transaction management) in a Spring Boot application?

### 12. Asynchronous Processing
- How do you implement asynchronous processing in a Spring Boot application? Discuss the use of `@Async` and strategies for handling exceptions in asynchronous methods.

### 13. Implementing Validation
- How do you implement validation in a Spring Boot application? Discuss the use of `@Valid`, `@Validated`, and custom validators.

### 14. Customizing Auto-Configuration
- How do you customize the behavior of an auto-configuration class provided by Spring Boot? Can you override a single bean from the auto-configuration, and if so, how?

### 15. Advanced Profile Management
- How can you use Spring Profiles for more than just environment management (e.g., dev, test, prod)? Describe a scenario where you dynamically switch between profiles at runtime.

### 16. Handling Circular Dependencies
- What is a circular dependency in Spring Boot, and how can you handle it when you have two or more beans that depend on each other?

### 17. Performance Optimization
- What are some key performance optimization strategies for a high-traffic Spring Boot application? Explain how to handle issues related to slow startup times or high memory consumption.

### 18. Conditional Beans and Runtime Decisions
- Explain how you can define beans conditionally in a Spring Boot application based on runtime conditions, such as environment variables or specific application properties.

### 19. Custom Error Handling
- How do you implement global error handling in a Spring Boot REST API? What are the differences between using `@ControllerAdvice`, `@ExceptionHandler`, and custom error attributes?

### 20. Thread Safety in Spring Beans
- Are Spring beans thread-safe? How would you design a multi-threaded Spring Boot application to ensure thread safety?

### 21. Security Configuration Complexity
- How would you configure Spring Security in a multi-module Spring Boot application, where different modules require different authentication and authorization mechanisms?

### 22. Reactive Programming Challenges
- What are some challenges when migrating a traditional Spring Boot MVC application to a reactive Spring WebFlux application? How do you handle blocking code, and what are some strategies to deal with it?

### 23. Transactional Management
- How would you manage transactions in a Spring Boot application involving multiple databases or a mix of relational and non-relational databases? Discuss the use of `@Transactional` in such a scenario.

### 24. Custom Actuator Endpoint
- How can you create a custom Spring Boot Actuator endpoint? Describe a scenario where this might be useful, and explain the steps involved.

### 25. Customizing Spring Boot Starters
- How would you create a custom Spring Boot starter for internal use within your organization? What are the key considerations to ensure it integrates seamlessly with other Spring Boot applications?

### 26. Integrating Third-Party Libraries
- You need to integrate a third-party library that uses XML configuration in a Spring Boot application. How would you manage this integration while maintaining a primarily Java-based configuration?

### 27. Advanced Caching Techniques
- How would you implement a caching strategy in a Spring Boot application that involves both short-term and long-term caches, using different underlying storage mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Ehcache)?

### 28. Custom Bean Scopes
- What are the different bean scopes available in Spring? How would you implement a custom bean scope in Spring Boot, and in what scenarios might you need to do this?

### 29. Handling Large File Uploads
- How would you handle large file uploads in a Spring Boot application, ensuring that you avoid memory issues and optimize performance?

### 30. Custom Spring Boot Banners
- How can you customize the Spring Boot startup banner, and why might you want to do so? Explain how you could display dynamic information in the banner.

### 31. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- How would you implement a circuit breaker pattern in a Spring Boot application to handle remote service failures? Compare the use of Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker with other libraries like Hystrix or Resilience4j.
